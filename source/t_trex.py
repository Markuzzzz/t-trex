# Signal Handlers
# Each signal may have a signal handler, which is a function that gets called when the process receives that signal. The function is called in
# "asynchronous mode", meaning that no where in your program you have code that calls this function directly. Instead, when the signal is sent to the process,
# the operating system stops the execution of the process, and "forces" it to call the signal handler function. When that signal handler function returns,
# the process continues execution from wherever it happened to be before the signal was received, as if this interruption never occurred.
def kill_program_handler(signum, frame):
    ''' This handler is called when the kill signal is received'''
    raise ProgramKilled

# When a signal arrives during an I/O operation, it is possible that the I/O operation raises an exception after the signal handler returns.
# This is dependent on the underlying Unix systemâ€™s semantics regarding interrupted system calls.
def heart_beat(signum, frame): # pylint: disable=unused-argument
    '''
        This function is the heart beat for updating the I/O service. It may not interrupt other I/O operations. All I/O should be handled from this handler,
        which will be executed in the main thread.
